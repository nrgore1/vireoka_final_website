# Vireoka Public Whitepaper

## Cognitive Governance

Artificial intelligence systems are increasingly making
decisions with real-world consequences. Accuracy alone
is no longer sufficient.

### The Problem
Most AI systems operate as black boxes:
- No policy enforcement
- No decision lineage
- No replay or auditability
- No confidence measurement

### The Vireoka Solution
Vireoka introduces **Cognitive Governance** — a framework
for building AI systems that are:
- Governable
- Auditable
- Policy-aligned
- Verifiable

### Core Capabilities
- Policy gates enforced at runtime
- Multi-agent council review
- Decision confidence scoring
- Immutable audit logs
- Replay and verification

### Why It Matters
When decisions affect trust, money, safety, or compliance,
organizations must be able to explain and defend them.

**Vireoka makes that possible by design.**
